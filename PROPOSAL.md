# Project Proposal

## Outline

 - Build a full question-answering system
   - API for communicating: Takes in question, returns answer
   - Build local corpus: Use [Yahoo Answers](http://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/) corpus or another one
   - Communicate with another API: [Yahoo Answers](https://developer.yahoo.com/answers/V1/questionSearch.html), [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/api), [KNGIN](http://www.kngine.com/QAAPI.html)
   - Shallow filtering: Use TF-IDF or BM-25 to get top-N results
   - Deep filtering: Use semantic-aware method to re-rank top-N results

## Objectives

 - Good performance on past TrecQA datasets
 - Come up with novel ideas for solving this problem
 - Make a submission for the competition
