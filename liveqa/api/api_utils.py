"""Defines some common utils for building APIs.

The main feature of these APIs is that they are multi-threaded; in the
background, there are a number of threads handling requests that maintain
resources across calls (so that resources don't have to continually be
reloaded).

In particular, a QueryJob holds the input (for example, a question), gets put
on a queue, processed, and triggers a flag to tell the calling process that
it finished. This behavior is useful because it allows the user to choose the
number of processing threads.
